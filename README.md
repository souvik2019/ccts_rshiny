## Purpose
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a nationwide online survey and database. To visualize any project involving
a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in REDCap, researchers can use the R Shiny application called “Recruitment Tracker.”
“Recruitment Tracker” aims to establish a free, interactive, and web-based dashboard
(https://uicccts.shinyapps.io/REDCap_Tracking/). The platform R Shiny allows users to interact with and visualize the data
according to their needs. The main function of this dashboard is to track the recruitment progress of an RCT project
using tools and functionalities that provide real-time statistical results. Thus, this dashboard can support users in making
decisions about recruitment progress and data collection based on the tracking reports.

The secondary function of the “Recruitment Tracker” is to visualize the characteristics of the participants assigned to
receive randomization in RCTs. Researchers can perform univariate and bivariate analyses on all demographic and clinical
variables of interest. All the results in the “Recruitment Tracker” presented in graphs and tables are able to be
downloaded.

The workflow of the modules of this interactive online dashboard is illustrated in Figure 1. “Recruitment Tracker” displays
the dataset in four modules of interest for users: “Verification & Setting,” “Project Summary,” “Recruitment Tracking,”
and “Descriptive Statistics.” “Recruitment Tracker” was made publicly available in Dec 2022. Advanced R Users may
request the R Shiny code to adapt the code for their specific visualization of R Shiny apps.
