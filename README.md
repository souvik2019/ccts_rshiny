# Rec Trac Project
## Purpose
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a nationwide online survey and database. To visualize any project involving
a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in REDCap, researchers can use the R Shiny application called “Recruitment Tracker.”
“Recruitment Tracker” aims to establish a free, interactive, and [web-based dashboard]
(https://uicccts.shinyapps.io/REDCap_Tracking/). The platform R Shiny allows users to interact with and visualize the data
according to their needs. The main function of this dashboard is to track the recruitment progress of an RCT project
using tools and functionalities that provide real-time statistical results. Thus, this dashboard can support users in making
decisions about recruitment progress and data collection based on the tracking reports.
